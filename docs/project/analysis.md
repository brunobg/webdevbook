# Analysis

In my opinion the rarest skill in people working on projects (and I include everyone there: developers, managers, designers, stakeholders) is **good and thorough analysis**.

Because it's hard to analyse a problem in detail. It requires a lot of thinking and a structured approach to the problem. It cannot be done by hand waving; it's like proving a math theorem.

Every time you add a new feature or piece of code you are increasing the number of potential combinations with other parts exponentially. So adding thing can break other things.

Fortunately since analysis requires a careful, structured approach, it responds well to methodologies.
