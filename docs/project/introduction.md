# Introduction

This section of the book is not about development itself, but about what every developer, every designer, every project manager, anyone who is directly part of a software project should know. It is of course a bit opinionated. But instead of trying to find a perfect formula that should be followed as a religion, it tries to point out things that don't work.

It's not easy to repeat success, particularly in business, but it's very easy to repeat failure. This section comes from my own experience working, managing and watching countless projects, and let me state you one thing:

Projects always fail for the same reasons.

And the reasons are almost always not technical. They have to do with project management, people, expectations. They have to do with treating software as a completely malleable thing, not realizing it needs just as much structure as a skyscraper. Perhaps because software is not physical -- even less than a book, because we see printed books -- people have no idea of what it is like, and your average non developer doesn't even know what it is, or have an idea of size and complexity.
