# Controllers

Controllers are the classes called by the routes when a request is made to your application.

::: tip
The use of Graphql with an automatic configuration loader such as [Lighthouse](https://lighthouse-php.com/) and authentication via OAuth makes writing controllers almost unnecessary. We'll briefly address how to implement them here for REST endpoints, as well as OAuth callbacks.
:::

There are plenty of libraries that help with a traditional REST endpoint structure, cutting down the amount of controller code you have to write. One example is [InertiaJS](https://inertiajs.com/), which not only has plenty of support on the backend, but has adapters for frontend as well.
