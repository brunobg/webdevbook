# Database

## Database

There are many flavors of databases these days. Classic SQL running locally, NoSQL, many cloud solutions. Laravel comes from the classic history of SQL servers, and we'll stay away from NoSQL.

As this is not a devops book, we'll not dive deeply into setup of the database. Cloud solutions often work with SQL, such as [AWS RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/), [Digital Ocean Managed Databases](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/databases/) and a multitude of other services. So you can use this book with your favorite cloud provider following its instructions for configuration.

For development it's wise to use the same kind of database you are using in production, so install MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server or your favorite flavor locally. Although we showed how to use SQLite in the [introduction](./introduction.md) it is a more limited DB by definition. You probably don't want to use it in production (at least for larger sites).
